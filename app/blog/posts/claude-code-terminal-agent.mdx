publishedAt: '2026-02-25'
summary: 'Claude Code is Anthropic's official terminal-based coding agent that understands your codebase, handles git workflows, and executes routine tasks through natural language. Here's what makes it different from other AI coding tools.'
---

Most AI coding assistants live in your browser or IDE. **Claude Code** lives in your terminal—and that changes everything.

## What is Claude Code?

Claude Code is an **agentic coding tool** from Anthropic that:

- Lives in your terminal (no browser needed)
- Understands your entire codebase
- Handles git workflows (commits, PRs, branches)
- Executes routine tasks through natural language
- Can be tagged directly on GitHub (`@claude`)

It's not just autocomplete. It's a full coding agent that can read your code, understand context, and make changes across multiple files.

## Installation

```bash
# MacOS/Linux (Recommended)
curl -fsSL https://claude.ai/install.sh | bash

# Homebrew
brew install --cask claude-code

# Windows
irm https://claude.ai/install.ps1 | iex
```

Then navigate to your project and run:

```bash
cd your-project
claude
```

## Key Features

### Codebase Understanding

Claude Code reads your entire project structure, understands imports, dependencies, and patterns. Ask it to explain complex code or find where a function is defined.

### Git Workflows

```bash
# Natural language git operations
"Create a branch for the auth feature and commit these changes"
"Open a PR with these changes"
"Explain what changed in the last 5 commits"
```

### Multi-file Edits

Make coordinated changes across multiple files—rename a function and update all imports in one command.

### GitHub Integration

Tag `@claude` on GitHub issues and PRs. The agent can read context and suggest fixes directly.

## Why Terminal-First Matters

**No context switching** - Stay in your development environment
**Scriptable** - Integrate with your existing shell workflows
**Works over SSH** - Use on remote servers and VPS
**Lightweight** - No heavy IDE plugins or browser tabs

## Plugins Ecosystem

Claude Code supports plugins for custom commands and agents. Check the [plugins directory](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/blob/main/plugins/README.md) for community extensions.

## Data & Privacy

Anthropic collects usage data (accept/reject rates, conversation data) but:
- Limited retention for sensitive info
- Restricted access to session data
- No training on your code without consent

## When to Use Claude Code

| Use Case | Good Fit? |
|----------|-----------|
| Refactoring large codebases | ✅ Excellent |
| Understanding legacy code | ✅ Excellent |
| Routine git operations | ✅ Great |
| Quick prototypes | ✅ Good |
| Browser-based work | ❌ Use v0 instead |
| Multi-step deployments | ❌ Use CI/CD |

## Bottom Line

Claude Code brings agentic coding to where developers already live: the terminal. If you're comfortable with CLI workflows, it's worth adding to your toolkit alongside browser-based tools like v0.
