I'm a passionate software engineer with experience building web applications and digital products. I specialize in frontend development with React and Next.js, but I'm also comfortable working with backend technologies like Node.js and NestJS.

My journey in tech started with a strong foundation in software development. I've worked with enthusiams friends to create intuitive, performant, and accessible digital experiences.

When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring new technologies, contributing to open-source projects, and staying up-to-date with the latest industry trends.
