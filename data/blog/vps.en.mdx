## What is VPS?

**VPS (Virtual Private Server)** is a virtual server created by dividing a physical server into multiple independent virtual servers. Each VPS has its own operating system, dedicated resources (CPU, RAM, storage capacity) and can be managed completely independently like a physical server.

### Core characteristics of VPS:

| Characteristic           | Description                                                     |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Virtualization**       | Runs on a physical server but operates as an independent server |
| **Private**              | Each VPS is isolated and doesn't affect other VPS instances     |
| **Full control**         | Root access, install any software                               |
| **Guaranteed resources** | CPU, RAM, storage are dedicated (or minimum guaranteed)         |

## How does VPS work?

<Image width={1000} height={600} src="/static/images/vps/how-it-works.svg" alt="How does VPS work" />

Virtualization technology is the foundation of VPS. A physical server (Physical Server) is divided into multiple virtual parts (Virtual Machines) through a virtualization layer called **Hypervisor**.

### Operation process:

| Step                    | Description                                             | Example                                |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| **1. Physical Server**  | Physical server with powerful hardware                  | CPU: 16 cores, RAM: 64GB, Storage: 1TB |
| **2. Hypervisor**       | Virtualization management software                      | VMware, KVM, Xen, Hyper-V              |
| **3. Virtual Machines** | Each VPS is an independent virtual machine              | VPS 1, VPS 2, VPS 3...                 |
| **4. Isolation**        | VPS instances are separated and don't affect each other | Each VPS has its own space             |

### Characteristics of each VPS:

| Component            | Details                                                        |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Operating System** | Linux (Ubuntu, CentOS, Debian) or Windows Server               |
| **Resources**        | CPU cores, RAM, Disk are dedicated                             |
| **IP Address**       | Dedicated IP address                                           |
| **Space**            | Operates independently, doesn't share with other VPS instances |
