During lower secondary school, I was a high‑achieving student. However, the disruption caused by the COVID‑19 pandemic in my ninth year led to a precipitous decline, and I came close to a dead end.

## The first steps of a career

- **During the summer after 10th grade**, as I was preparing to enter 11th, I met a friend on Discord who introduced me to the world of web development. He showed me how to create a simple website and shared a few valuable resources that helped me build my first foundation.

- **At first**, my knowledge was scattered — just some basic HTML/CSS and a few clumsy JavaScript snippets. My first project was far too simple to publish, but it taught me something important: to commit in small steps, to test early, and to pay attention to every line in the logs.

- **Over time**, I realized that becoming “good” at programming isn’t about using the newest or shiniest framework. It’s about solving one small problem completely, every single day — and letting those small victories slowly shape who you are as a developer.

## Introduction myself

- **If I had to describe myself**, I’d probably say I have some kind of “condition” that makes it nearly impossible for me to focus on anything I’m not interested in for more than fifteen minutes. But luckily, my mom gave me something better — traits that make up for it: curiosity, persistence, and endless patience for the things that truly capture my attention.

- **When I was a child**, my dad used to tell stories about how I would take apart anything I could get my hands on — as long as I had a screwdriver. Sometimes I managed to put them back together, and sometimes… not quite (haha). But I think that was my first step into understanding how things work.

- **I’ve always had a good memory** and a strange way of thinking about logic — patterns, structures, and how one piece connects to another. That mindset turned out to be incredibly useful when I chose to become a programmer. There were days when I spent ten to fourteen hours straight learning to code, solving problems for myself and for others.

- **It was an intense but beautiful time**. Even a single day away from my IDE felt uncomfortable — as if something inside me needed to keep creating, keep learning, and keep debugging the world one line of code at a time.

## Learning experience

- **After a while** — not too long, but not too short either — I found myself completely immersed in the syntax of JavaScript, TypeScript, HTML, CSS, and the countless tips and tricks that make software development so fascinating. Along the way, I’ve gathered a few experiences that I’d like to share.

- **For those who are still unsure of what they want to do in the IT field**, my first piece of advice is this: find your strength and identify which role fits you best. It could be frontend, backend, fullstack, DevOps, security, or something related to data or system architecture. Knowing what you want — and what you need to do to get there — truly makes all the difference.

- **If you’ve already discovered one or a few areas you’re passionate about**, then focus on them. Be consistent, put in the effort, and stay patient. This is not the time for hesitation — your choices today shape your future. Alongside technical skills, invest time in soft skills like communication, language learning, and life management. These will not only make your work easier but also make your journey more fulfilling.

- **And if you’ve already found your footing in a certain role**, keep pushing forward. Learn from your peers, colleagues, and mentors. Build relationships, grow your career, and never let “stability” be your limit. This industry is brutally fast-paced — it demands continuous growth, constant innovation, and a willingness to reinvent yourself.

- **Keep improving, keep exploring** — and maybe one day, you’ll find yourself among the top 1% of the best in the world. (That’s what I’m aiming for too, haha.)

## Mistakes in my life and how to avoid them

- **Of course, life was never meant to be that easy**.
  There was a time when I became so obsessed with coding that I began to neglect everything else — my studies, my health, even the things that truly mattered to me.

- **The summer between 10th and 11th grade was a particularly difficult period**. I remember forgetting to do my homework because I was so focused on understanding an important programming concept that I believed would shape my future. My math teacher eventually kicked me out of class, and I was devastated.

- **What hurt me more was not the punishment**, but how gently my mother responded. She didn’t scold me harshly; instead, she spoke softly, reminding me to find balance in my life. Her kindness struck me deeply, and I promised myself I would change.

- **Another mistake** — I sacrificed my health and school performance for my passion. I attended school in the morning, extra classes in the afternoon, and did homework at night. So when did I find time to code? Late at night. There were nights when I stayed up until 2 or 3 a.m. practicing, completely lost in code.

- **The next morning**, I would drag myself to school with a cup of coffee, trying to keep my eyes open while exhaustion weighed me down. Long hours of sitting and lack of exercise made me gain weight and feel constantly unwell.

- **So if you’re a student** — in middle school or high school — reading this, please listen to me: find balance. Spend time with your family, focus on your studies, and make memories with your friends. Go out, laugh, explore new places. Because once you enter university, life changes drastically.

- **My first year in college was painfully lonely** — far from home, without friends, and away from the person I loved. It was a difficult time for an eighteen-year-old who once thought passion alone could carry him through everything.

## Conclusion

- **Looking back**, I realize that programming has given me much more than just technical skills — it taught me about discipline, patience, and the importance of balance. Passion is a beautiful thing, but without balance, it can easily consume you.

- **Now**, I try to see programming not just as a skill to master, but as a lifelong journey — one where I grow a little every day, both as a developer and as a person. I’ve learned to code smarter, not just longer; to take breaks without guilt; and to appreciate the people who support me along the way.

- **I still dream big** — to become one of the top 1% in my field, to build products that matter, and to inspire others who walk the same path. But more importantly, I’ve learned that success isn’t just about achieving goals — it’s about staying kind, curious, and passionate no matter how far you go.

- **And if I could tell my younger self one thing**, it would be this:

> [!IMPORTANT] > **Keep chasing your passion, but don’t forget to live.**
