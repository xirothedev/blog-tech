## What is a Vector Database?

A Vector Database (also called Vector Store) is a specialized type of database designed to **store, manage, and search vector data** (embeddings). Unlike traditional databases that store data as numbers, strings, or booleans, vector databases work with multi-dimensional numerical arrays representing object embeddings.

### Core differences

**Traditional Database:**

- Storage: `ID: 1, Name: "John Doe", Age: 25`
- Search: Exact match - only finds when values match exactly
- Example: Searching `name = car` won't find `xe hơi` or `ô tô`

**Vector Database:**

- Storage: Vector embeddings like `[0.23, -0.45, 0.67, ..., 0.12]` (typically 384-1536 dimensions)
- Search: Similarity search - finds based on semantic similarity
- Example: Searching `xe hơi` can return `ô tô`, `xe cộ`, `automobile` based on meaning

### What is an Embedding?

An embedding is a way to represent complex data (text, images, audio) as numerical vectors in multi-dimensional space. Objects with similar meanings will have vectors close to each other in this space.

- **Text**: "Car" and "Automobile" → vectors close together
- **Images**: Cat photo and cat image → vectors close together
- **Audio**: Same person's voice → vectors close together

## How does a Vector Database work?

	alt="How does a Vector Database work"
/>

Working with a Vector Database involves 3 main steps:

### Step 1: Create Embedding

Input data (text, images, audio) is converted into vectors using embedding models:

- **Text**: BERT, GPT embeddings, sentence-transformers
- **Images**: ResNet, CLIP, Vision Transformers
- **Audio**: Wav2Vec, Whisper embeddings

**Example:**

```
Input: "Red car"
↓ Embedding Model (BERT)
Output: [0.23, -0.45, 0.67, 0.12, ..., -0.34] (768 dimensions)
```

### Step 2: Store in Vector Database

Vectors are stored and indexed using special algorithms to optimize search speed:

- **HNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World)**: Hierarchical graph, fast search
- **IVF (Inverted File Index)**: Divides space into clusters
- **LSH (Locality Sensitive Hashing)**: Hash functions to group similar vectors

### Step 3: Similarity Search

When a query is made, the system will:

1. **Convert query to vector**: Query text/image → embedding vector
2. **Calculate similarity**: Compare query vector with all vectors in database
3. **Return Top-K results**: Vectors with highest similarity

**Similarity calculation methods:**

- **Cosine Similarity**: Measures angle between 2 vectors (most common)
- **Euclidean Distance**: Euclidean distance
- **Dot Product**: Dot product

**Example:**

```
Query: "Car"
↓
Top 3 Results:
1. "Red car" - Similarity: 0.95
2. "Sports car" - Similarity: 0.87
3. "Traffic vehicle" - Similarity: 0.82
```

## Why do we need Vector Databases?

### Comparison with Traditional Databases

| Feature           | Traditional Database                                                             | Vector Database                                                    |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Data type**     | Numbers, strings, boolean                                                        | Vectors (embeddings)                                               |
| **Search method** | Exact match                                                                      | Similarity search                                                  |
| **Example Query** | `SELECT * WHERE name = "car"`                                                    | Find vectors closest to query vector                               |
| **Use Cases**     | E-commerce, CRM, Financial records                                               | Semantic search, RAG, Recommendation, AI apps                      |
| **Limitations**   | ❌ Doesn't understand semantics<br/>❌ Can't find `xe hơi` when searching `ô tô` | ✅ Understands semantics<br/>✅ Finds semantically related results |

### 1. **Semantic Search**

Traditional databases don't understand meaning. If you search for `car`, it won't find `xe hơi` or `automobile`. Vector databases solve this by searching based on meaning.

**Real-world examples:**

- Search `today's weather` → Finds `current climate`, `today's temperature`
- Search `black cat photo` → Finds all black cat photos even with different captions

### 2. **Performance for AI/ML**

Vector databases are specially optimized for similarity search:

- Can search through **millions to billions of vectors** in milliseconds
- Traditional databases would be very slow when comparing each vector with the query

### 3. **Multi-modal Support**

A vector database can store embeddings from different types of data:

- Text, images, audio in the same vector space
- Cross-modal search: Find images with text query, find text with image query

### 4. **Foundation for AI Applications**

Many modern AI applications depend on vector databases:

- **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)**: ChatGPT with knowledge base
- **Recommendation Systems**: Netflix, Amazon, Spotify
- **Anomaly Detection**: Fraud detection, anomaly detection
- **Semantic Search**: Enterprise search, document retrieval

## Where are Vector Databases used?

### 4. **🖼️ Image & Video Search**

Search images/videos based on content:

- **Reverse image search**: Google Images, TinEye
- **Visual similarity**: Pinterest "More like this"
- **Content-based retrieval**: Find videos with similar scenes

### 5. **⚠️ Anomaly Detection**

Detect abnormal patterns:

- **Fraud detection**: Detect fraudulent transactions
- **Security monitoring**: Detect unusual intrusions
